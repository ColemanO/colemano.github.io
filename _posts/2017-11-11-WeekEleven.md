<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
<br>
During this past week, I took a chemistry test and finished the project for this class. I originally also had an essay due but the due date was pushed back to the coming Tuesday. Planning the thesis of that essay was what I spend the majority of today doing.
<br>
<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
<br>
I have an essay due on Tuesday in my culture class and it is proving difficult to write. The class is on vampires in Slavic cultures (a class I needed to take to finish my culture sequence) and it is proving very difficult to find a topic that interests me to write about. In the essay, we are supposed to write a three-page paper comparing two of the works presented in class. This is difficult because I find it difficult to write three pages about vampires. For the last essay, I talked more about the artistic aspects of the works and my reaction to them as works of art which seemed to work well. I am considering doing something similar and comparing two literary works from the same author as that author and his peer's transition between Sentimentalism and Romanticism.
<br>
<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
<br>
Next week I will work on my essay and my compilers project. The compilers project is supposed to take longer than normal so I am trying to finish the essay before the weekend is over so I can focus on compilers. I will also be trying to get a good part of the beta version of the app my team and I are supposed to be making for my iOS class done. It is due the week of Thanksgiving.
<br>
<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
<br>
The last project took longer than expected. We had many hang up that we did not anticipate and working without getters and setters proved more difficult than we thought.
<br>
<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
<br>
My partner for the last project introduced me to meld which is essentially a GUI for resolving merge conflicts. You can install it with brew and it makes understanding the conflicts between two files and resolving them much easier.
