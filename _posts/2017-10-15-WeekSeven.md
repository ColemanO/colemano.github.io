<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
<br>
Over the past week, I had 2 projects due, a test and two interviews. It was a busy and stressful week. The week started with me forgetting my keys and laptop charger at one of my Monday meetings and consequently being locked out of my apartment. I carry keys to pretty much all of my stuff so losing that permanently would have been a great hassle and I was thankful when they were still where I left them to come the morning. Later in the week I was driving to campus so that I could drive to my interview after class, running low on sleep and slightly distracted about my coming interview, as someone was coming up in the garage of my apartment complex and I was going down I tightened my turn a bit to make room for them and scraped my car door against the side of the garage. Needless to say, it was not the best week for me and although I tried to handle everything I had to do this week I definitely felt I could have done better on everything if I had had more time. That's always the case though. 
<br>
<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
<br>
This past week, just finding enough time in the day and not burning out held me back from doing my best on everything during the week. 
<br>
<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
<br>
This next week I only have one test on Monday after which I plan to start on my work for the week after. The week after is a very busy week and I would like to avoid a repeat of this week. 
<br>
<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
<br>
I was not having a great week and I believe I ended up with a B on the test which is less than I was hoping for but now that I know what to expect I will definitely know what to focus on for the final. I still really enjoy the class and the knowledge I gained about C++ helped me in an interview last week. 
<br>
<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
<br>
My tip of the week would probably to get ample sleep before interviews. They require you to be quick and to think critically both things that are degraded without sleep. Even if you feel you have not prepared enough being alert should be a priority. There is not much you can do in a couple of hours of preparation that you can know will help you on an interview but a couple of extra hours of sleep will almost certainly help. I made this mistake this past week and I felt as though I came across as distant and uninterested because of how tired I was. For me, it had more to do with just how busy in general I was but I will definitely prioritize sleep over study next time.
