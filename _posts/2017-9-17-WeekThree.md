<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
<br>
Over the past week, the college of natural sciences career fair occurred along with other networking and internship opportunity events. As a result, I have been very stressed trying to balance finding an internship with school work.
<br>
<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
<br>
I can feel a cold coming on it's probably because I haven't been getting very much sleep over the past couple of weeks. I've been finding it very difficult to find time to do everything that I need to do. 
<br>
<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
<br>
Next week I have another project and test. In addition to these things, I will most likely be attempting to catch up in the two classes that I didn't attend on Thursday in order to go to the career fair. Next week is a relatively light week so hopefully, I can catch up on some sleep. 
<br>
<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
<br>
Emran has been a great TA. Aside from his responsiveness on Piazza, and his knowledge of the material, the extra office hours that he holds when he is just around in GDC have proved extremely helpful at least to me. We are all busy and the fact that he takes that time to help students outside of his regular office hours is greatly appreciated. 
<br>
<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
<br>
My pick of the week is <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com">Quick Draw</a> by Google. It is an AI experiment that is attempting to gather data on people's drawings so that it can better recognize drawings. The website frames it as a guessing game and has the user draw for 20 seconds while the computer attempts to guess what is being drawn. Interestingly as stated in <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59bMh59JQDo">this video</a> because human's are training the neural network, the population that is training it has introduced its own bias toward a certain type of drawing. (in the video the example they use is a shoe)
