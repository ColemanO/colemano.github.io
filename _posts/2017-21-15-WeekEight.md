<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
<br>
I took the past week to relax a bit and to prepare for the coming week. I took on several design projects for the design organizaiton I am a part of and have been dealing with a lot of the administrative aspects of the organization such as trying to figure out the system for getting our designers paid for the work they do as well as onboarding some more administrative people. I also worked on the project for this class which has been going quite well and the project for one other class which is also due next week.
<br>
<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
<br>
Currently I am working on a promotional video for a client of the organization that I mentioned and the client is very slow to get me the materials I need to create it and resultantly the project is taking more time than expected. This is unfortunate considereing I have a busy week next week.
<br>
<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
<br>
Next week I plan to finish the project for this class and several of my other classes and study for the two tests I have.
<br>
<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
<br>
The class has been enjoyable. The format of the class is really starting to grow on me and with every project I see more and more of the value of the industry tools that we are being taught how to use.
<br>
<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
<br>
This may not be new to some people but I didn't know about it. My tip of the week is :vsplit in vim. A friend told me about this earlier this week and it allows you to have multiple files open in a split screen format and yank and paste between them. I had previously just opened up two terminal windows. There is so much functionality I don't even know about in vim. I am excited to learn.
