<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
<br>
Over the past week, I've been preparing for the career fair, interviewed with a company and have been trying to get ahead on my homework for the coming week.
<br>
<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
<br>
I added two classes late and have consequently been trying to catch up in those classes which is making it difficult to get ahead in preparation for the career fair.
<br>
<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
<br>
Next week, I have an exam, will likely be working on the project for this class as well as the project for my compilers class and will be attending the career fair.
<br>
<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
<br>
Learning about the tools presented to us in class such as google test and travis.ci has been very interesting. I have not had a chance yet to get a real good start on the project though I did get everything set up and got a successful Travis build which was a struggle by itself. Hopefully now things will go more smoothly.
<br>
<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
<br>
My pick of the week is <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a>. It is a project management tool that I originally was using for an organization that requires a lot of collaborative work but I've also started using it for my own personal to-do lists. It is really a nice tool to have especially if you are working on a team.
