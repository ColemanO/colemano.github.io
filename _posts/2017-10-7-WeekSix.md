<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
<br>
Over the past week, I have been working on refining my online profiles on LinkedIn and handshake, as well as my resume. I also have been in contact with some recruiters and have interviews coming up that I have been studying for. In addition, I had a test and an essay due. Surprisingly I did not feel that busy and I have been trying to make time to work on my personal projects. 
<br>
<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
<br>
Though not extremely busy, I was still not feeling physically well enough to run this week but I am feeling much better as of yesterday. I plan on going for a run after I finish this blog post. 
<br>
<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
<br>
In the coming week, I have several interviews, several projects and the test for this class coming up. This next week is going to be very busy and important. I am trying to get a head start on my week right now so that I don't become overwhelmed during the week. This is challenging because I also bought Sunday tickets to ACL so Saturday, today, is really the only day that I have to knock out a good amount of work. 
<br>
<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
<br>
The interactive nature of the class this week, particularly on Wednesday was very helpful in understanding the functions we went over and in getting more familiar with C++. 
<br>
<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
<br>
My pick of the week is <a href="https://histography.io">histography</a>. It is a timeline of essentially every major event that we have recorded. The website creates historical events based on events in Wikipedia and displays each one as a dot on the timeline. You can explore a time period by mousing over it. If you click the event you can even see related events presumably through linked Wikipedia articles within the article currently being viewed. It is a very neat website that shows the power of the interactive malleable interfaces that computers have given us. This unmanageable wealth of information has been taken and elegantly displayed in a way easy for anyone to understand.
