title: Week 9

<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
<br>
The past week was definitely a rush but felt far better than week seven. I was far more prepared for the week because of the preparation I did the week prior. I had several tests and several projects due and I went to HackTX. I believe the tests and projects went fine but HackTX was uneventful and my team ended up leaving early. We came in with an ambitious idea and ran into snags along the way that took too much time to resolve. Next year we will aim to do something more reasonable.
<br>
<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
<br>
Last week I finished up a promotional video for a startup that took far longer than I anticipated. It took a huge chunk out of my week and was the cause of the majority of my stress last week. The company kept wanting revisions that would mean a complete trash and restart of the project. It was very frustrating.
<br>
<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
<br>
Next week I have the alpha version of our project due in my iOS class and a test in compilers. Though not a huge load I am worried about the compilers exam. I plan to study the rest of today and all of tomorrow for it. I have been falling a bit behind on the material in that class.
<br>
<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
<br>
The class is structured very well. The weekly quizzes and student interaction force me to keep up with the material and on my toes. It is great when contrasted with my compilers class which I have fallen behind in due to putting other more pressing things first.
<br>
<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
<br>
Something I knew about but was reminded of this weekend was vimtutor. For anyone looking for a place to learn vim, this is a great place to start. I will probably use the program myself soon because though I have been forcing myself to use vim recently there are still several basic things I don't know how to do and the program could probably fill in those gaps.
