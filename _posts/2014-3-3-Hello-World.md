<strong>What are your expectations of the class? (special question, first time only)</strong>
<br>
Apart from object oriented programing concepts I hope to learn about industry tools and become knowlagable in C++. I expect that the class will include a fair amount of reading and time. Overall, I expect to get a lot of valuable information and experiences from the class.
