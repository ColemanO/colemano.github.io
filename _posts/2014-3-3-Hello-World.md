<strong>What are your expectations of the class? (special question, first time only)</strong>
<br>
Apart from object oriented programing concepts I hope to learn about industry tools and become knowlagable in C++. I expect that the class will include a fair amount of reading and time. Overall, I expect to get a lot of valuable information and experiences from the class.
<br>
<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
<br>
Over the past week I've been feeling out my new classes and catching up with friends before school really gets going.
<br>
<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
<br>
This semester I took my 18 year old dog with me from San Antonio. The responsibility that comes with that and getting used to the added comute time when I need to return to my apartment to feed or let him out is taking some adjusting.
<br>
<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
<br>
Next week I will hopefully be able to finish an iOS game I have been working on and submit it to the app store. In addition I have a date planned with my girlfriend and am preparing for the coming interview season.
<br>
<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
<br>
So far the class has been very engaging. Exploring C++ and docker were very interesting and I look forward to the readings and learning more about OOP. I was nervious about the quiz but I ended up not finding it very difficult. Hopefully this will put me at ease for the next one.
<br>
<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
<br>
My pick of the week is <a href="https://github.com/stephenway/monokai.terminal">this</a> terminal theme that makes the terminal a lot more pleasing to look at and especially makes working in vim through ssh easier on the eyes.
