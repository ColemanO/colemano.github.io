<strong>What are your expectations of the class? (special question, first time only)</strong> <br>
I have heard that the class teaches you a lot about industry tools and C++ which I hope to learn a lot about. I expect the class to include a fair amount of reading that will prove valuable in learning object oriented concepts as well as other topics previously mentioned. Overall I expect to get a lot of valuable information and experiences from the class.
