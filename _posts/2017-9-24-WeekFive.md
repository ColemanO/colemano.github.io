<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
<br>
The week was fairly relaxed. I had been proactive on my compilers project and the project for this class since there were due on the same day. I got both of them done early because my compilers project took less time than I thought it would. Over the weekend I went back to visit my family and friends in San Antonio. I celebrated my cousin's birthday, my friend Roger's birthday. In addition to catching up with all of the normal people, I also got to see my cousin James who I haven't seen in several months. He recently finished his training for dentestry and his new practice is going well.
<br>
<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
<br>
I currently have a cold it has been inhibiting my ability to get finish what I want to get done. Although I think it peaked yesterday so hopefully during the coming week it will not be as bad. Because of this I was not able to run last week as I said I would in my last blog post.
<br>
<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
<br>
I have several tests and and essay next week so I will be working on those. I will also be attempting to run like I said I would in the last blog post. Hopefully my cold doesn't get in the way this week. My main concern is getting more sick but I know a run would clear my head and make me feel better. Also the weather is starting to look really nice especially in the mornings.
<br>
<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
<br>
I had an esspecially bad week in terms of quizes this week but hopefully that will change next week. I find myself rushing and missing the small things on the quizzes. I think that I need to become better aquainted with C++ so that I am not so rushed. The class content otherwise is engaging. I like how deep we are diving into C++, it allows me to apreciate the design and the amount of thought put into the language.
<br>
<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
<br>
My pick of the week is <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/#">Google's material design guidlines</a>. They provide essentually a "visual language" as they put it for how software that follows the guidlines should look and feel. They take classic visual design principals and adapt them to work that is maluable and changing like software interfaces. It is really a great resource for anyone interested in UX/UI.
