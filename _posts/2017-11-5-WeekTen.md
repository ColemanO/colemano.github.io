title: Week 10

<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
<br>
Over the past week, I took a compilers test, worked on the project for OOP and worked on some personal projects. After my compilers test the week was fairly relaxed. I did not do as well as I wanted to on my compilers test but I now have a better idea of what I should study for the final. Hopefully, that will result in a better grade. I also am going to try and stay more on top of the material in that class which should also help.
<br>
<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
<br>
I have not been sleeping a whole lot the last couple of weeks due to just being busy and my body is now collecting on my sleep debt. Over the weekend I have taken many naps and slept at least 7 hours each night. It is inhibiting my productivity but I think I can afford it this week. Sleep is important to function properly and hopefully now that I feel my weeks are lightening up I can start getting more of it.
<br>
<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
<br>
I have been running sporadically but nothing consistent. I hopefully will be able to start consistently running or lifting in the mornings. Exercising was something that was very important to me my freshman and sophomore year and this year I have definitely let other things take precedence over it and it's something I want to get back into.
<br>
<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
<br>
Starting the last project was a struggle because when clicking on the classroom link instead of allowing me to create a new team, my only option was to accept the challenge with my old team. This was an issue that I saw many students experience. Emran ended up making my team's repo for us. I don't know how others got around this issue and I don't know what I should do if I encounter it again. I will go to office hours this week to ask about that so I don't get stuck in the same situation come the next project.
<br>
<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
<br>
In vim, :%s/pattern_to_replace/what_to_replace_with finds instances of pattern_to_replace and replaces them with what_to_replace_with. If you add /gc at the end then you can go through and individually confirm each replacement. This proved very helpful for reusing things such as the makefile for the current project.
