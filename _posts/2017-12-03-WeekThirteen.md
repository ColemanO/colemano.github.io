<strong>Lecture</strong>
<br>
Professor Downing is a great lecturer and its evident that each lecture has a very distinct purpose and defines a key feature of C++. The "conversations" that he has with random students will keep you engaged. I would recommend reviewing the notes before class briefly to familiarize yourself with what he is going to be talking about. It can be difficult at times to understand where Downing is going with a point. Reviewing the notes helps with this so that you don't get lost during lecture.
<br>
<strong>Quizzes</strong>
<br>
The quizzes take some adjusting, I went on a couple streaks of 2/6s and got a few 0s but it was nothing I couldn't recover from. Downing drops a generous amount of quizzes probably because of this and the fact that there are so few questions on each quiz. The best way I found to do well was to review the material before the lecture over it and then for a few minutes before the quiz tries to pick out key points of the lecture. Another thing I found helpful when I was having a bad week for quizzes was to try and predict what questions would be asked. This becomes fairly easy after a while.
<br>
<strong>Projects</strong>
<br>
The projects in the class were not extraordinarily difficult. The hardest project by far was Darwin. Trying to figure out how to work around not using getters and setters without a concrete example was difficult and I'm still not sure that I fully understand the concept. I feel as though the way that my partner and I ended up doing it was not correct. Regardless, overall they were very manageable projects and taught me a lot about industry tools such as continuous integration, GitHub features, and tools like gcov and valgrind. Overall the projects proved very valuable.
<br>
<strong>Exams</strong>
<br>
I have only taken one exam but it was fairly reasonable. I did not know how to study for it and overwhelmed myself with the details of Downings notes. Hopefully, I will do better on this coming exam. I feel as though I know what to study now and it is just a matter of finding the time to do it with all the other exams and projects I have this week.
<br>
<strong>Overall</strong>
<br>
Overall the course was great. I learned a lot about C++ but not much about OOP. We learned what makes a good OOP language and how C++ OOP compares to Java but in terms of OOP concepts the majority of what we learned was through readings and was not enforced through lecture. To be fair I understand that UT's intro teaches many OOP concepts in Java.
