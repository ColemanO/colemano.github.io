<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
<br>
Over the past week, I've been getting back into running and I worked on my compilers project. I started going to run club again on Tuesday and Wednesday. I felt really good having a group of people to pace with and to push me. After not running for several weeks I was able to keep a 7:30 pace for almost 4 miles. I had to rest after Wednesday and my compilers project ended up taking far longer than I expected.
<br>
<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
<br>
My compilers project took far too long. I spent most of the week working on it. I had waited too long to start expecting the project to take the same length as the previous projects. It took far longer and now I've pushed other things such as starting the OOP project and the beta for my iOS project back. I will probably need to work on the OOP project over the break now which is not ideal.
<br>
<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
<br>
Next week is Thanksgiving and I will be going home on Wednesday. Monday and Tuesday I plan on going to run club again. I will also take a chemistry test, turn in my iOS beta and work on the OOP project. One of my good friend's birthdays is today and some of our friends from high school are flying in to surprise him on Tuesday night. That should be a good time but hopefully, he does not leave before then.
<br>
<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
<br>
My experience in the class has not changed. It is challenging and I feel as though I have learned a lot about C++ and some about object-oriented design. The comparisons between C++ and Java are always interesting.
<br>
<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
<br>
My tip of the week is for anyone preparing for technical interviews to use leetcode. The questions are questions that have been asked in interviews before and the more practiced you are the calmer you will be when it comes to the real thing.
